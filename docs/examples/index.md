# Examples and tutorials

In this section of the documentation, we will take you through some simple and more advanced topics related to building and running Calliope pathway optimisation models.

The ["national scale" example][national-scale-example-model-pathway-optimisation] builds a model for part of a national grid, exhibiting the following Calliope functionality:

* Introduction to `investsteps` and `vintagesteps`.
* Use of initial capacities.
* Use of technology lifetimes that fall _between_ investment steps.
* Technology investment costs that change with technology vintage.

The ["stationary" example][stationary-model-of-pathway-optimisation] builds a simplified model of Italy with costs and demand which do not vary across investment steps or between technology vintages.
It is a boilerplate model on which to build more complex pathway scenarios.
