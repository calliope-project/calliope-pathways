  available_initial_cap:
    $ref: "#/$defs/TechParamNullNumber"
    default: 0
    x-type: float
    title: The per-investment step fraction of initial capacity that is still available.
    description: >-
      Removes the defined fraction of initial capacity (`flow_cap_initial`, `storage_cap_initial`, etc.) in each investstep.
      This is usually defined over the `investsteps` dimension to provide different fractions (ultimately adding up to 1) per investment step.
    x-unit: fraction.

  available_vintages:
    $ref: "#/$defs/TechParamNullNumber"
    default: 0
    x-type: float
    title: The per-investment step fraction of new capacity being decommissioned.
    description: >-
      Removes the defined fraction of initial capacity (`flow_cap_initial`, `storage_cap_initial`, etc.) in each investstep.
      This is usually defined over the `investsteps` dimension to provide different fractions (ultimately adding up to 1) per investment step.
    x-unit: fraction.

  flow_cap_initial:
    $ref: "#/$defs/TechParamNullNumber"
    default: 0
    x-type: float
    title: Initial / existing flow capacity in pathway optimisation.
    description: >-
      Sets `flow_cap` lower bound in first investment period during pathway optimisation.
    x-unit: power.

  area_use_initial:
    $ref: "#/$defs/TechParamNullNumber"
    default: 0
    x-type: float
    title: Initial / existing area use in pathway optimisation.
    description: >-
      Sets `area_use` lower bound in first investment period during pathway optimisation.
    x-unit: $\text{area}^{2}$.

  storage_cap_initial:
    $ref: "#/$defs/TechParamNullNumber"
    default: 0
    x-type: float
    title: Initial / existing storage capacity in pathway optimisation.
    description: >-
      Sets `storage_cap` lower bound in first investment period during pathway optimisation.
    x-unit: energy.


  storage_initial:
    $ref: "#/$defs/TechParamNullNumber"
    default: 0
    x-type: float
    title: Initial storage level.
    description: >-
      Set stored flow in device at the first timestep, as a fraction of total storage capacity.
    x-unit: fraction.

  source_cap_initial:
    $ref: "#/$defs/TechParamNullNumber"
    default: 0
    x-type: float
    title: Initial / existing source capacity in pathway optimisation.
    description: >-
      Sets `source_cap` lower bound in first investment period during pathway optimisation.
    x-unit: power.
