    x-type: float
    title: The per-investment step fraction of initial capacity that is still available.
    description: >-
      Removes the defined fraction of initial capacity (`flow_cap_initial`, `storage_cap_initial`, etc.) in each investstep.
      This is usually defined over the `investsteps` dimension to provide different fractions (ultimately adding up to 1) per investment step.
    x-unit: fraction.

    x-type: float
    title: The per-investment step fraction of new capacity being decommissioned.
    description: >-
      Removes the defined fraction of initial capacity (`flow_cap_initial`, `storage_cap_initial`, etc.) in each investstep.
      This is usually defined over the `investsteps` dimension to provide different fractions (ultimately adding up to 1) per investment step.
    x-unit: fraction.
